Hi, I'm Ali a high school student from Iraq with a big dream: to study Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in Japan through the MEXT scholarship.

This GitHub is where I document my learning journey from writing my first lines of Python code to building small AI projects that reflect what Iâ€™ve learned.

I believe that real progress comes from doing, not just studying. Every file here represents a lesson, a mistake, a fix, or a breakthrough and together, they show how Iâ€™m growing step by step.

Iâ€™m not an expert. Not yet. But Iâ€™m determined. And this is my way of turning that determination into something real.

Welcome to my journey.
